# Show yourself quotes script
set this up in your /etc/profile.d if you want to see your favourite quotes
when you ssh into your servers.

can add multiple sources in the config file, the more you add the more of a rainbow you'll create in your console.
must follow this format
`path=/path/to/quotes current_line=1`

if you add too many you may run out of colours though, I only added like 5.
